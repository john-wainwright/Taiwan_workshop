Files for the Connectivity workshop at National Taiwan University on 3rd June 2025.

If running in Colab, download the file Connectivity_part_1_colab.ipynb from the scripts folder and then upload it to Colab.  Then take the data folder and copy it into your Drive space.  (See the fuller instructions in the ipynb file.)

If running on a local machine, download the scripts and data folders.  You can then either:
  - open Connectivity_part_1.ipynb as a standalone Jupyter notebook; or
  - open Connectivity_part_1.py in an IDE like Spyder
In both these cases, if you have the scripts and data folders in the same folder on the computer, the scripts should run without needing to change any of the paths.
